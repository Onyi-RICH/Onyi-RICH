## About Me

I am a **data professional with 6+ years of experience** across financial data management, analytics, and business intelligence, complemented by hands-on work in **data engineering, machine learning, and explainable AI systems**.

My work focuses on building **reliable, transparent, and reproducible data and AI solutions**, particularly for environments where **data quality, auditability, and accountability** are critical. I enjoy working at the intersection of **data, engineering, and decision-making**, translating complex information into systems stakeholders can trust.

Currently based in **Germany**, I am seeking **immediate full-time opportunities** in **data-driven, research-oriented, or public-sector environments**.
