## 🚀 About Me

Hi! I’m **Onyi**, a data professional with **6+ years of experience** across financial data management, analytics, and data engineering — complemented by advanced training in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and ETL systems**.

My journey started in finance and operations, where data accuracy and accountability mattered deeply. Over time, I transitioned into more technical roles, building **end-to-end data pipelines**, **machine learning models**, and **analytics solutions** that improve data quality, operational efficiency, and decision-making.

I describe myself as a **data detective** 🕵️‍♀️ — curious, detail-oriented, and motivated by connecting technical insights to real-world impact. I enjoy working at the intersection of **data, business, and engineering**, making complex information actionable for stakeholders.

Currently finishing a **data internship at Webeet.io**, and **open to full-time opportunities** in **Data Analytics, Data Science, or Data Engineering** across Germany.
