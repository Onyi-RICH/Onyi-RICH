## 🚀 About Me

I am a **data professional with 6+ years of experience** across financial data management, analytics, and business intelligence, combined with **advanced training in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering.**

My journey started in finance and operations, where data accuracy and accountability mattered deeply. Over time, I transitioned into building **end-to-end data pipelines, machine learning models,** and **analytics solutions** that improve data quality, operational efficiency, and decision-making.

I describe myself as a **data detective** 🕵️‍♀️ — curious, detail-oriented, and motivated by connecting technical insights to real-world impact. I enjoy working at the intersection of data, business, and engineering, making complex information actionable for stakeholders.

My background is grounded in **Statistics and Economics**, with hands-on experience in **predictive modeling, NLP/LLM applications, database architecture, and large-scale data** using **Python and SQL**. I value **rigorous methodology, reproducibility, and clarity**, translating insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.
I recently **completed a Data Science certification** and am currently based in Germany, seeking **immediate full-time opportunities** in **data-driven or research-oriented environments**.
