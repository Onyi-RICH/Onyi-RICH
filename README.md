## 🚀 About Me

I am a **data professional with 6+ years of experience** spanning financial data management, analytics, and business intelligence, complemented by **advanced training in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering**.

My career began in finance and operations, where **data accuracy, governance, and accountability**  mattered deeply. Over time, I transitioned into designing and building **end-to-end data pipelines, machine learning models, and analytics systems** that improve data quality, operational efficiency, and decision-making.

I describe myself as a **data detective** 🕵️‍♀️ — curious, detail-oriented, and motivated by uncovering patterns that matter. I enjoy working at the intersection of **data, engineering, and business**, translating complex information into insights that stakeholders can trust and act on.

My foundation is rooted in **Statistics and Economics**, with hands-on experience in **predictive modeling, NLP/LLM applications, database architecture, and large-scale data processing** using **Python and SQL**. I value **rigorous methodology, reproducibility, and clear communication**, especially when working with both technical and non-technical audiences.

I recently completed a **Data Science certification** and am currently based in **Germany**, actively seeking **immediate full-time opportunities** in **data-driven, AI-focused, or research-oriented environments**.
